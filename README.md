# HAKG
We introduce Hybrid Hyperbolic Graph Reasoning modules (H2GR) that incorporate multi-view semantic correlations into node embeddings via Poincare and Lorentz graph reasoning modules to enhance their semantic representational ability. We also propose an interactive mechanism to gather different features of two modules across multiple layers. To evaluate the performance of H2GR, we conduct experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets.
